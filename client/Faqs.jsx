        <Accordion.Header>What is the dress code? What should I wear?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          The dress code for our wedding is semi-formal. Wear something you’re comfortable in—button-up shirts, long or short flowy dresses, or whatever brings you joy. Since our ceremony will take place outdoors on grass, we recommend avoiding stiletto heels so you won’t get stuck!

        <Accordion.Body>
          This is for all you coming from out of town! While we can’t control the weather, history shows that it should be a sunny clear day with highs in the mid 70’s or low 80’s. As the sun sets the lows could be as cool as the mid 50’s.
